        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a refreshing Chinese dish that reminds me of my dad's cheerful mood as he calls me from downstairs.
        </p>
        <p> "Better than Ramsey Gordon!" he'd exclaim <em>(of course with Gordon Ramsay's name out of order from habit of talking in Chinese)</em>.
            A mixing bowl full of cold, crispy cucumbers topped with chili oil and cilantros would sit in his arms, tilted so that I could capture them in all their glory.
        </p>
        <p> In college, I would prepare enough of this to last me a whole week to eat alongside a bowl of rice and some protein of my choosing <em>(which would usually be some simple eggs with my lack of experience in the kitchen)</em>.</p>
       
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cucumbers</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>3 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chili oil</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 handful of cilantro</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the cucumbers and slice them into bite sized pieces <em>(or if you're using smaller cucumbers, smash them with the flat side of the knife just so that they crack open)</em>.
            Set aside in a bowl and add salt <em>(this will help crisp them up)</em>.</li>
            <li>Mince the garlic and add to a small bowl. Mix with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, chili oil, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Rinse off your cucumbers and pat them dry. Then plate the cucumbers, drizzle the sauce over it, and garnish with chopped cilantro. Enjoy with a bowl of rice and other dishes, or by itself as a healthy snack!</li>
        </ol>
