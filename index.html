        <h1>Recipes for College</h1>
        <p>In my second year of university, I lived in a small on-grounds apartment with five other girls, so it is no mystery that our kitchen was not impressive.
            The same goes for the meals that came out of that kitchen.
            In order to keep myself alive while pulling late nighters learning algorithms on the dining table, I learned to prepare a number of simple but refreshing recipes from Pinterest and TikTok:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./recipes/soba.html">Cold Soba Noodles</a></li>
                <a href="./recipes/soba.html"><img src="./images/soba.jpg"></a>
                <li><a href="./recipes/garlicchilicucumber.html">Garlic Chili Oil Cucumbers</a></li>

                <a href="./recipes/mayakgyeran.html"><img src="./images/mayakgyeran.jpg"></a>
            </ul>
